//About this
Reaper's default missing file search function only finds files in the specified directory and does not search in child directories.
Running this script will search all files in the path you enter, including child directories.

//How to use
This script is loaded and run from the actions tab in the reaper menu.
When the dialog box opens, you can enter the path.
Please enter the full path of the main directory (relative paths are not allowed).

The name of the file must be exactly the same as item was before it became missing.
If the name has been changed, it cannot be detected.

//Other
No debugging or support will be provided.
Feel free to modify it.

I learned about re-link through chatgpt.
But it's not on his github, nor can I find it in any online archives.
It's possible that he deleted it, or that it doesn't exist in the first place.
